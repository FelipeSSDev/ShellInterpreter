# ShellInterpreter
Shell Interpreter created for FATEC Americana, Digital Games course. "Operating Systems" class - Second semester

Simple Shell clone that aims to recreate a few of it's functions and was part of my final grade for Operating Systems

Code is only compatible with Linux, so any Operating System based on the Linux Kernel should be able to run it
